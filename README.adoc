== What you'll learn 

You will learn how to access a REST service and deserialize the returned JSON that contains a list of artists and their albums by using an HTTP client with the ReactJS library. You will then present this data using a ReactJS paginated table component.

https://reactjs.org/[ReactJS^] is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. Its main purpose is to incorporate a component-based approach to create reusable UI elements. ReactJS also allows you to interface with other libraries and frameworks. Note, the names ReactJS and React are used interchangeably.

The React application in this guide is provided and configured for you in the `src/main/frontend` directory. The application uses the https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html[Create React App] prebuilt configuration to set up the modern single-page React application. The [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app]`create-react-app` integrated toolchain is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

artists.json
[source, json, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/src/resources/artists.json[]
----

The REST service that provides the resources was written for you in advance in the backend of the application, and responds with the [hotspot]`artists.json` in `src/resources`. You will implement a ReactJS client as the front end of your application, which consumes this JSON and displays its contents on a single-page webpage. 

To learn more about REST services and how you can write them, see
https://openliberty.io/guides/rest-intro.html[Creating a RESTful web service^].

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. The React front end is already pre-built for you and the static files from the production build can be found in `src/main/webapp/static`.

To try out the application, navigate to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:

[role='command']
```
mvn liberty:run
```

After you see the following message, your application server is ready.

[role="no_copy"]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----

Then, point your browser to the web application root http://localhost:9080[http://localhost:9080^] to see the following output:

// =================================================================================================
// Starting the service
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the service

Before you begin the implementation, start the provided REST service so that
the artist JSON is available to you.

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

[role='command']
include::{common-includes}/devmode-start.adoc[]

After you start the service, you can find your artist JSON at the
http://localhost:9080/artists[http://localhost:9080/artists^] URL. 

Note: all the dependencies for the React front end can be found in `src/main/frontend/src/package.json`, and 
they are installed before building the front end by the `frontend-maven-plugin`. Additionally, there are also some provided `CSS` stylesheets files that can be found in `src/main/frontend/src/Styles`.

// =================================================================================================
// Project configuration 
// =================================================================================================

== Project configuration

The front end of your application uses Node.js to build your React code. The Maven project is configured for you to install Node.js and produce the production files, which are copied to the web content of your application.

Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime used for developing networking applications. Its convenient package manager, https://www.npmjs.com/[npm^], is used to execute the React build scripts found in the `package.json`. To learn more about Node.js, see the official https://nodejs.org/en/docs/[Node.js documentation^].

The [hotspot=frontend-plugin]`frontend-maven-plugin` is used to [hotspot=node-resource-install]`install` the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file from the npm registry into a folder called `node_modules`. The `node_modules` folder can be found in your [hotspot=working-dir]`working` directory. Then, the configuration [hotspot=node-resource-build]`produces` the production files to the `src/main/frontend/build` directory. 

The [hotspot=copy-plugin]`maven-resources-plugin` copies the `static` content from the [hotspot=directory]`build` directory to the [hotspot=output-directory]`web content` of the application.

== Creating the default page

You need to create the entry point of your React application. `create-react-app` uses 
the [hotspot file=0]`index.js` file as the main entry point of the application. This JavaScript file 
corresponds with the [hotspot file=1]`index.html`. This is the entry point of where your code runs in the browser.

----

The [hotspot=import-react file=0]`React` library imports the [hotspot=import-react file=0]`react` package. The performance benefit in using React is evident through the Virtual DOM that it offers, which is essentially a copy of the browser DOM that resides in memory. The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. The Virtual DOM improves the performance of your web application as it plays a crucial role in the rendering process. The [hotspot=react-dom file=0]`react-dom` package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used in your application to get outside of the React model, if necessary. 

The [hotspot=dom-render file=0]`render` method takes an HTML DOM element and tells the ReactDOM to render your React application inside of this DOM element. See, https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html[ReactDOM^] to learn more about the Virtual DOM.

// =================================================================================================
// Creating the React components
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the React components

A React web application is simply a collection of components. Each component has a specific function. You will create the components that are used in the application to acquire and display data from the REST API. 

App.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/App.js[]
----

ArtistTable.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=get-posts,mount-posts,axios-library']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/ArtistTable.js[]
----

The main component in your React application is the `App` Component. You will need to create the [hotspot file=0]`App.js` file to act as a container for all other components. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `App.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/App.js`
----

The `App.js` file returns the [hotspot=react-component file=0]`ArtistTable` component to create a reusable element that encompasses your web application. 

Next, you'll create the `ArtistTable` component that will fetch data from your backend and render it in a table. 

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `ArtistTable.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/ArtistTable.js`
----
The [hotspot=react-library file=1]`React` library imports the `react` package for you to create the [hotspot=class file=1]`ArtistTable` component as an inheritance of the `React Component`, and use its values. The [hotspot=state-object file=1]`state` object is initialized to represent the state of the posts that will appear on the paginated table. The `ArtistTable` component also needs to be [hotspot=export-artisttable file=1]`exported` as a reusable UI element that can be used across your application.

To display the returned data, you will use the practice of pagination. Pagination is the process of separating content into discrete pages, and it can be used for handling data sets in React. In your application, you'll render the columns in the paginated table. The [hotspot=table-info file=1]`columns` constant is used to define the table present on the webpage.

The [hotspot=return-table file=1]`return` statement returns the paginated table where you have defined the properties for the [hotspot=table file=1]`ReactTable`. The [hotspot=110 file=1]`data` property corresponds to the consumed data from the API endpoint and is assigned to the `data` of the table. The [hotspot=113 file=1]`columns` property corresponds to the rendered column object and is assigned to the `columns` of the table.

// =================================================================================================
// Importing the HTTP client
// =================================================================================================

=== Importing The HTTP client

Your application needs a way to communicate with and retrieve resources from RESTful web services, in order to output the resources onto the paginated table. You will use the https://github.com/axios/axios[Axios^] library to provide you with an HTTP client. This client will be used to make HTTP requests to external resources. Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that allows you to send asynchronous requests to REST endpoints. To learn more about the Axios library and its HTTP client, visit the https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios[Axios documentation^].

ArtistTable.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/Components/ArtistTable.js[]
----

The [hotspot=get-posts]`getArtistInfo()` function will use the Axios API to fetch data from your backend. 
It will be called when the `ArtistTable` is rendered to the page using 
the [hotspot=mount-posts]`componentDidMount()` React lifecycle method.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `ArtistTable.js` file.#
`src/main/frontend/src/Components/ArtistTable.js`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Add the [hotspot=axios-library]`axios` library and the [hotspot=get-posts]`getPosts()` function. 
Next, add the [hotspot=mount-posts]`componentDidMount()` method into your Component. 

The [hotspot=axios]`axios` HTTP call is used to read the artist JSON
containing the data from the sample JSON file in `resources`. 
On successfully getting a response, the state of the system changes by 
assigning [hotspot=response-data]`response.data` to [hotspot=data]`posts`. 
The [hotspot=convert-data]`convertData` function manipulates the 
JSON data to allow it to be accessed by the `ReactTable`. You will notice the 
[hotspot=spread-one hotspot=spread-two]`object spread syntax` that the `convertData` function uses,
which is a relatively new sytnax made for simplicity. 
To learn more about it, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#Spread_in_object_literals[Spread in object literals^].

[hotspot=set-state]`this.setState` is used to update the state of your React component with the data fetched from the server. This triggers a re-render of your React component which will update the table with the artist data. For more information on how state in React works, see the React documentation on https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html[State and Lifecycle].

// =================================================================================================
// Building and packaging the front end
// =================================================================================================

== Building and packaging the front end

On successfully building your components, you need to build the
front end and package your application. The Maven `process-resources` goal generates the Node.js resources,
creates the frontend production build, and copies and processes the resources into the destination directory. 

In a new command-line session, build the front end by running the following command:

[role='command']
----
mvn process-resources
----

You can rebuild the front end at any time with the Maven `process-resources` goal.
Any local changes to your JavaScript and HTML are picked up when you build the
front end.

Navigate to the http://localhost:9080[http://localhost:9080^] web application root to view 
the front end of your application.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the React client
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the React client

When you create a new project with `create-react-app`, it comes with a test file
called [hotspot file]`App.test.js`, which is included in `src/main/frontend/src`. This is a simple JavaScript file that tests against the `App.js` component. There are no explicit test cases written for this application. 
The `create-react-app` configuration uses https://jestjs.io/[Jest^] as it's test runner. To learn more about Jest, follow their documentation on https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react[Testing React Apps^]. 

App.test.js
[source, javascript, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/src/main/frontend/src/App.test.js[]
----

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

[role="code_command hotspot file=1", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `pom.xml` file.#
`pom.xml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
To run the default test, you can add the [hotspot=node-tests file=1]`testing` configuration to the `frontend-maven-plugin` and re-run the Maven `process-resources` goal.

Although the React application in this guide is simple, when you build more complex React applications, testing becomes a crucial part of your development lifecycle. If you need to write application-oriented test cases, follow the official testing documentation on the 
https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html[React testing document^].

When you are done checking the application root, exit development mode by pressing CTRL+C in the shell session where you ran the server, or by typing q and then pressing the enter/return key.
